# Software
The P2WDB ecosystem is composed of different software packages:

- [ipfs-p2wdb-service](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-p2wdb-service) will run a local instance of the P2WDB and will automatically sync its local database with other P2WDB instances on the network. This is akin to running a 'full node' for a blockchain.
- [p2wdb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/p2wdb) is a JavaScript library for node.js and browsers. It allows easy reading from and writing to the P2WDB.
- [p2wdb-pinning-service](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/p2wdb-pinning-service) is a plugin for ipfs-p2wdb-service that turns the IPFS node into a file pinning service.
