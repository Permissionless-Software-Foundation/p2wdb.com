# Introduction

The Pay-to-Write Database (P2WDB) is an **censorship-resistant database**. It's similar to a blockchain, but better optimized for data. The code base is maintained by the [Permissionless Software Foundation](https://psfoundation.info).

P2WDB is similar to blockchain in these ways:
- The database has many redundant copies spread across the globe. They sync with one another using consensus rules. This makes the database very difficult to censor, and a great place to store sensitive data that may be subject to censorship.
- A token is used to pay for writes, the [PSF token](https://psfoundation.cash). The cost is approximately $0.01 USD per write.

Unlike a blockchain, the database is optimized for storing data:
- Each entry can store up to 10 KB of data.
- Data is guaranteed to be available for a year. After that, it naturally falls off the network.

The P2WDB is built on top of the [Cash Stack](https://cashstack.info). The community of developers can be contacted on [this Telegram channel](https://t.me/bch_js_toolkit).
