# Introduction

The Pay-to-Write Database (P2WDB) is an open, decentralized, peer-to-peer (p2p) database. Like a blockchain, the database has many redundant copies spread across the globe. They sync with one another using consensus rules. This makes the database very difficult to censor, and a great place to store sensitive data that may be subject to censorship. Unlike a blockchain, the database is optimized for storing data. Each entry can store up to 10 KB of data, and costs 0.01 [PSF tokens](https://psfoundation.cash).

There are a handful of repositories that make up the P2WDB ecosystem:

- [p2wdb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/p2wdb) is a JavaScript library that can be used by web apps to read from and write to the P2WDB.
- [ipfs-p2wdb-service](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-p2wdb-service) is a node.js JavaScript app that will install and run an instance of the P2WDB.
