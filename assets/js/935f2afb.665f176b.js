This makes the database very difficult to censor, and a great place to store sensitive data that may be subject to censorship. Unlike a blockchain, the database is optimized for storing data. Each entry can store up to 10 KB of data, and costs 0.01 PSF tokens.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"local-back-end/circuit-relay":{"id":"local-back-end/circuit-relay","title":"Circuit Relays","description":"An IPFS Circuit Relay is an IPFS node that can help two other IPFS nodes communicate across the internet, when a firewall would otherwise block them from talking to one another.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"local-back-end/index":{"id":"local-back-end/index","title":"Local Back End","description":"The concept of a \'local\' back end does not apply to the web 2 paradigm.
